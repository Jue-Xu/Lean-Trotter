# Module 4b Phase 5: Taylor-Reduction for `w4Residual`

This module reduces the τ⁴ pointwise bound for `w4Residual A B p τ` to
four concrete order-condition hypotheses on its iterated derivatives at
τ = 0.

## Strategy

`w4Residual` is `ContDiff ℝ ⊤` (proved in Suzuki4DerivExplicit as
`contDiff_w4Residual`). Apply Mathlib's
`exists_taylor_mean_remainder_bound` with `n = 3` to obtain:

    ∃ C, ∀ τ ∈ [0, t], ‖w4Residual(τ) - taylorPoly₃(τ)‖ ≤ C · τ⁴

If the Taylor polynomial of order 3 vanishes identically
(`taylorPoly₃ ≡ 0`, which is equivalent to vanishing of the first four
iterated-derivative values at τ = 0), then we get the desired bound

    ‖w4Residual(τ)‖ ≤ C · τ⁴  on [0, t].

## Status

This file provides:
- `exists_norm_w4Residual_t4_bound_of_zero_taylor`: the conditional
  reduction (PROVED)
- `taylorWithin_eq_zero_of_iteratedDerivs_zero`: the Taylor polynomial
  vanishing lemma (PROVED)
- `norm_suzuki4_fifth_order_of_vanishings`: close `norm_suzuki4_fifth_order`
  conditional on the four iteratedDerivWithin vanishings (PROVED)
- `norm_suzuki4_childs_form_of_vanishings`: close `norm_suzuki4_childs_form`
  conditional on the same (PROVED)

The residual work is the four derivative-vanishing hypotheses, which
are the genuine Module 4b content (order 0: proved via
`w4Residual_at_zero`; orders 1-3: Suzuki order conditions `palindromic
+ cubic cancellation` — see comments).

## Taylor polynomial vanishes iff the first `n+1` iterated derivatives vanish

For a `ContDiff` function `f : ℝ → 𝔸` with `iteratedDerivWithin k f (Icc 0 t) 0 = 0`
for all `k ≤ n`, the Taylor polynomial `taylorWithinEval f n (Icc 0 t) 0 τ` is 0.
-/

/-- If the first `n+1` iterated derivatives (within `Icc 0 t`) of `f` at `0` all vanish,
  then the `n`th Taylor polynomial of `f` at `0` (within `Icc 0 t`) is identically `0`. -/

## Main conditional reduction

Given the four order-vanishing hypotheses, produce the τ⁴ bound on `w4Residual`.
-/

/-- **Phase 5 conditional reduction**: given the vanishing of the first four
  iterated derivatives of `w4Residual A B p` at `τ = 0` (within the interval
  `[0, t]`), there exists a constant `C` such that
  `‖w4Residual A B p τ‖ ≤ C · τ⁴` for `τ ∈ [0, t]`.

  The four order-vanishing hypotheses correspond to Suzuki S₄ order conditions
  (palindromic + cubic cancellation). -/

## Order-0 vanishing (trivial consequence of `w4Residual_at_zero`)

The zeroth iterated derivative of `f` is just `f` itself. Hence the order-0
condition reduces immediately to the known fact `w4Residual A B p 0 = 0`.
-/

/-- **Order-0 vanishing**: `iteratedDerivWithin 0 (w4Residual A B p) s 0 = 0`
  for any set `s`. Immediate from `iteratedDerivWithin_zero` and
  `w4Residual_at_zero`. -/

## Bridge: `iteratedDerivWithin` at 0 within `[0, t]` = `iteratedDeriv` at 0

For `0 ≤ t`, the within-derivative at the left endpoint of `Icc 0 t` agrees
with the global `iteratedDeriv` (since `w4Residual` is `ContDiff ℝ ⊤`). This
converts the remaining orders 1-3 vanishing hypotheses into the equivalent
simpler `iteratedDeriv` form, which may be easier to prove via explicit
derivative calculations.
-/

/-- Bridge: `iteratedDerivWithin k (w4Residual A B p) (Icc 0 t) 0` equals
  the global `iteratedDeriv k (w4Residual A B p) 0`, for `0 < t`. -/

## Closing the two outer sorries

The final assembly uses `norm_suzuki4_order5_from_residual_bound` from
`Suzuki4DerivExplicit`, which converts a τ⁴ pointwise bound on
`w4Residual` into a `t⁵/5`-scaled bound on `suzuki4Exp`.
